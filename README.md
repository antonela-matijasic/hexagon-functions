# hexagon-functions
The hexagon functions repository provides master integrals and the basis functions for two-loop six-point Feynman integrals. 

Brief description of files:
- MomentumTwistorParametrization.m – expressions for kinematic variables in terms of our momentum twistor parametrization,
- SqrtRepl.m – replacement rules for square roots r<sub>i</sub> ’s, \epsilon<sub>ijkl</sub>’s and \Delta<sub>6</sub>,
- Alphabet.m – function alphabet in terms of Mandelstam variables,
- UTBasis_fam.m – canonical bases for the each family,
- DE_fam.m – canonical differential equations for each family,
- BoundaryConstants_fam.m – analytic boundary constants for all top sector and sub-sector integrals for families under study,
- Weight2Solutions_fam.m – analytic solutions at weight one and two for each family,
- LineIntegration.nb – A proof–of–concept implementation of the one–fold integration in Mathematica.

The planar two-loop six-point families are: the double-pentagon (dp), hexagon-box (hb), pentagon-box (pb), double-box (db), pentagon-triangle (pt) and hexagon-bubble (hbb).
